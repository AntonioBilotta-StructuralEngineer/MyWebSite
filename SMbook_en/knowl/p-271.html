<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The experimental parameters encountered so far are Young's modulus, \(E \text{,}\) the shear modulus, \(G \) and the Poisson's ratio, \(\ nu \) . It has also been said, see previous section, that the number of coefficients strictly necessary to define the constitutive tensor is equal to 21. It therefore seems that the experimental results discussed so far are very insufficient to reach a complete definition of the elastic relationship. Fortunately, most of the materials used in the usual engineering applications are <em class="emphasis">isotropic</em>. That is, they have the property that, given a block of material and any direction is chosen to <em class="emphasis">cross it</em> by means of experimental tests, the same mechanical response is always detected. For this class of materials, applicable to metals, glass, polymers, soils and, in some ways, even cement or bituminous conglomerates, the constitutive characterization can be carried out by <em class="alert">only 2 experimental parameters</em>.</p>
