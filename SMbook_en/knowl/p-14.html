<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Where does the need to know a computational language and to use automatic calculation tools come from? Probably this requirement is not at all a peculiarity of the Mechanics of solids since it is now at the basis of all the disciplines that can be placed in the field of applied mathematics. But let's limit our gaze to what interests us most, namely how an engineer does his job. Fifty years ago a fresh engineering graduate was very good at using a slide rule or a manual mechanical analog calculator. But now thanks to the digital revolution, which began in the 80s with the advent of the first personal computers and still in progress, there is the possibility of holding in one hand a computing power that in 1969 was used by NASA to send the man on the moon. To complete a drastically changed scenario, the widespread diffusion of the Internet over the last decade has done the rest by opening the door to the “internet of things”. </p>
