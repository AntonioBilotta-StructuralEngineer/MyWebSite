</h6>The first chapter deals with the kinematics of deformable bodies by defining the basic tools for describing the geometric transformation of bodies regardless of the causes that produced it. The topic is used as a “gym” to get familiar ourselves with all the mathematical tools necessary for solid mechanics. However, a systematic description, which very often becomes a list, of the necessary notions of algebra and tensor calculus is avoided. But the individual topics of algebra or calculus are recalled by keeping as much contact as possible with the kinematics subject for which are required. As delivering medium I chose short video lessons that are more accessible, in a preliminary instance, than the descriptions provided in the reference texts of Continuum Mechanics or Mathematics to which the student should always draw for further information.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="preface_en.html#li-1">in-context</a></span>
