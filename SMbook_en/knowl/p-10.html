<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In engineering schools it has become quite customary to provide an introductory course to <em class="emphasis">Solid mechanics</em>, better known in Italy as <em class="emphasis">Scienza delle costruzioni</em>, comprising two fairly distinct themes: <em class="emphasis">Continuum mechanics</em> and <em class="emphasis">Statics</em>. The first theme studies deformable bodies while the second one, in engineering and architecture schools, embraces a series of topics that go well beyond the equilibrium of rigid systems to which the word “Statics” refers. Covering, even only at an introductory level, both topics within a six-month course surfing the vast number of texts and web resources already available on the two themes, however, would give rise to a labyrinthine path for the student. With respect to Continuum mechanics the student would tackle textbooks which, for the chosen language, are largely devoted to algebra and tensor calculus basics or, for the part regarding Statics, with texts that use a completely different language and methodologies that can be placed in the field of <em class="emphasis">Mechanics of structures</em>.</p>
