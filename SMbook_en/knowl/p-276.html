<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In the previous discussion, the elastic law was presented keeping the description of the part concerning the normal components separate from that relating to the tangential components. This certainly to better highlight the lack of certain couplings between stress components and strain components, but also for the impossibility of representing in a compact way the components of a 4th tensor such as the constitutive tensor. In fact, while for the tensors of the 2nd order the representation of all the components is realized through the associated matrix, for a 4th tensor there is no similar representation.</p>
