<p>The material proposed here is composed of the following chapters: the first three deal with continuum mechanics and the following two are dedicated to rigid systems.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The first chapter deals with the kinematics of deformable bodies by defining the basic tools for describing the geometric transformation of bodies regardless of the causes that produced it. The topic is used as a “gym” to get familiar ourselves with all the mathematical tools necessary for solid mechanics. However, a systematic description, which very often becomes a list, of the necessary notions of algebra and tensor calculus is avoided. But the individual topics of algebra or calculus are recalled by keeping as much contact as possible with the kinematics subject for which are required. As delivering medium I chose short video lessons that are more accessible, in a preliminary instance, than the descriptions provided in the reference texts of Continuum Mechanics or Mathematics to which the student should always draw for further information.</li>
<li>In the second chapter the notion of <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">continuity hypothesis</em> at the basis of continuum mechanics is clarified to subsequently move on to the treatment of bodies under the action of external agents. By this way we arrive at the definition of the Cauchy stress tensor and the related equilibrium equations. The link between the static description of the bodies and the kinematic description presented in the first chapter is also established through the principle of virtual work.</li>
<li>In the third chapter it is verified that the equations presented in the previous chapters are not enough to solve the problem of a deformable body, however constrained, subjected to assigned actions. Additional experimental information must be added to the model, defining a relationship between stress and deformation in a generic point of the body. To this end, Hooke's law is used as a reference model. Its generalization to pluri-axial states allows general form of the elastic constituive law. After defining the general formulation of the elastic problem, the reduction of the 3D model to the simpler and more manageable one-dimensional model for the analysisi of 2D straight beams is also discussed.</li>
<li>In the fourth chapter, kinematics presented in first chapter is applied to rigid systems allowing to experiment the kinematic description of bodies in a simplified context. The main types of constraints applicable to a body are discussed and a systematic procedure to be used for the kinematic analysis of rigid body systems is identified.</li>
<li>The fifth chapter is devoted to the discussion of rigid systems from a static point of view. The relative equations of equilibrium, the notion of constraint reaction and free body diagram allow to identify a systematic procedure for the static analysis of rigid body systems.</li>
