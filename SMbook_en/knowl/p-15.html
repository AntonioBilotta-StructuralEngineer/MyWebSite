<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Returning to MATLAB®, an acronym for MATrix LABoratory, the software was born <a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-1-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.0.0.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> expressly as a tool for the automatic manipulation of matrices but over the years it has been enriched with such and many features that it is more correct to define it as follows: “a multi-paradigm numerical computing environment and proprietary programming language developed by MathWorks®” (source Wikipedia). Therefore, being a subject in itself very vast, no information on its use is provided in this text. This information is available, as indicated in <a href="references_frontmatter_en.html" class="internal" title="References: using MATLAB®">using MATLAB®</a>, on the MATLAB® supplier website, a source that should be considered the most reliable and authoritative. The applications and exercises provided in MATLAB® in the text therefore serve to acquire a computational language and to learn how to use an automatic calculation tool, certainly not the only one available nowadays, suitable for an uptodate approach to the study of Solid mechanics.</p>
