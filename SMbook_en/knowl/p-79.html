<p>What is described in previous video lesson can be summarized as follows.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The determinant is a real number which constitutes the scale factor of the areas, in the case of 2D transformations, or of the volumes, in the case of 3D transformations.</li>
<li>From this perspective a null determinant is associated with transformations that scale to zero areas or volumes described in the initial space to which the transformation is applied. For example in 2D, the determinant is zero if all the points of the starting space are mapped on a line or, in the most extreme case, on a single point. In the 3D case, a transformation has zero determinant if it maps the points in a plane, in a straight line or in a single point. In these cases the columns of the matrix associated with the transformation are linearly dependent.</li>
<li>The determinant can also be negative because it also carries information about a possible change of orientation of the area or of the starting volume. This occurs when the transformed vectors of the basis do not respect the right hand's rule.</li>
