</h6>In the third chapter it is verified that the equations presented in the previous chapters are not enough to solve the problem of a deformable body, however constrained, subjected to assigned actions. Additional experimental information must be added to the model, defining a relationship between stress and deformation in a generic point of the body. To this end, Hooke's law is used as a reference model. Its generalization to pluri-axial states allows general form of the elastic constituive law. After defining the general formulation of the elastic problem, the reduction of the 3D model to the simpler and more manageable one-dimensional model for the analysisi of 2D straight beams is also discussed.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="preface_en.html#li-3">in-context</a></span>
