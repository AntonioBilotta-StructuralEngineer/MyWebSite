<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The typical scenario is, however, reversed. That is, given the tensor \(\tens{U} \text{,}\) we want to evaluate the principal stretches and directions. Solving this question means calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix associated with the tensor \(\tens{U}\text{.}\) In this section the procedure to be used in the solution of the eigenvalue problem will not be presented because this constitutes a topic that has certainly already been studied in previous courses and for which the available literature, also online, is vast. Here it was considered more important to highlight the mechanical meaning of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, meaning widely discussed in the previous sections.</p>
